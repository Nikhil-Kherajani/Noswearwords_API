## About The Project

This is a REST API code that has been implemented using the Express.js framework.

The API listens to incoming HTTP POST requests on the endpoint "/check-for-swear-words" and takes in a JSON request body that has a single property "text", which is a string that needs to be checked for the presence of swear words.

## Core Features

<b>The API returns a JSON response containing two properties:

* <b>"containsSwearWord": A boolean value indicating whether the input string contained a swear word.</b>
* <b>"swearWord": A string that contains the first swear word found in the input string.</b>

<br />

    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: "It's not okay to use the word fuck" }),
